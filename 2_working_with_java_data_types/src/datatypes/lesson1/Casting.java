/*
    Explicit casting is required when 'narrowing' types, i.e.
    trying to put a value from a larger type into a smaller type.
    Literals that fit into the range of the smaller types will not require a
    cast. However literals that exceed the range, and expressions, will require
    an explicit cast.

    Remember that whole number literals are stored as int by default.
